# A2A Java SDK Reference Server Integration

This is a reference server for the A2A SDK for Java, that we use to run tests, as well as to demonstrate examples.

It is based on [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io), and makes use of Quarkus's [Reactive Routes](https://quarkus.io/guides/reactive-routes).

It is a great choice if you use Quarkus!
